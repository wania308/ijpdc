msgstr ""

#: ../../features/breaks.rst:14
msgid "Tabbycat supports multiple and arbitrarily-named break categories. Most tournaments will have just one category, typically called \"Open\", leading to the grand final. Some tournaments also have restricted-eligibility break categories, for example, for novice teams or teams for whom English is a second language."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/breaks.rst:19
msgid "Having multiple break categories is intended for tournaments where multiple *parallel* elimination phases derive from the *same* preliminary rounds (inrounds). It's not for parallel but distinct competitions---for those, you should create distinct tournaments."

Tabbycat will create the break category and break rounds for you. For any further break categories, you'll need to go to the **Breaks** item in the left-hand menu for a particular tournament and then click **Break Categories**. Fill out the forms for the number of new break categories and save. Rounds will be created automatically. You'll still need to set the eligibility of teams though, as in (3) below."

msgid "Creating a draw for a break round proceeds as normal, except that the team availability process is skipped. Instead, when you visit the availability page for that round it will have automatically determined which teams should be debating based upon the determined break for that category. Once a draw has been generated it will then use the relevant break ranks to create the matchups (ie 1st-breaking vs 16th-breaking, 2nd vs 15th, *etc.*). Subsequent break rounds will then also automatically determine matchups based on the previous round's results and room ranks."

#: ../../features/breaks.rst:171
msgid "If the \"break size\" of a break category is not a power of 2, it will treat the first break round as a partial-elimination draw and only create a draw for the teams not skipping the partial-elimination round. Subsequent break rounds will then process as described above."
