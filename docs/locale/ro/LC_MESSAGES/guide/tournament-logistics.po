msgid "Unlike the rest of our documentation, this section does not deal with particular features or technical concerns with Tabbycat itself. Instead it is an attempt to outline the logistics of tab direction and aims to be of general relevance for people running major tournaments. At present, it is organised by the various ‘stages' of tabbing a tournament, and most of the content takes the form of check-lists or comments designed to highlight and provide guidance on common issues."

msgid "Whilst it aims for general relevance, we should note that this guide is relatively opinionated and mostly written from the perspective of people whose primary experience is tabbing at Australasian tournaments using Tabbycat. That said, we welcome feedback and additions that can account for different format and regional considerations. In the future, if the guide becomes more general and more extensive, it could be spun off into a separate project."

msgid "You should avoid being the sole person responsible for that tab unless it is a small tournament. There are many cases where you want to be in several places at once and the easiest way to accommodate that is by having co-directors or trusted assistants. Few tab decisions require a single source of authority; it is far better to have multiple people available to share responsibilities around."
msgstr ""

#: ../../guide/tournament-logistics.rst:23
msgid "In a similar manner, it is worth considering how you can use the tournament to help train other people. Typically, knowledge of tabbing is concentrated in relatively few people and gained mostly through on-the-ground experience; meaning that every tournament should be approached as rare opportunity to help spread knowledge about tabbing more widely in a circuit. Consider reaching out to institutions or the tournament as a whole to see if they have anyone who would be interested in helping out."

Depending on the license of your tabbing software and the nature of your tournament (for profit vs not for profit) this may be required.

For example, with 39 teams, you should have both an 40th swing team to fill in the draw, and the option to easily assemble an 41st swing team in case a team goes missing. At very large tournaments (say over 150 teams) you should plan for even more swing team capacity — it's not unheard of for say three teams to vanish all in a single round. In these cases, you should try and ensure that the swing teams are always ready to go — i.e. that that they are pre-formed, you have a clear communication channel with them, and that they distributed/waiting near the debating rooms so they can fill in at a moment's notice (often you will only find out that teams are missing right as debates are scheduled to start)."

msgid "How will critical information be communicated to participants? Consider that in general, Facebook announcements do not reach many people, although paying to boost the posts is often a very cheap way of dramatically raising their effectiveness. In particular also ensure or check how you manage to get in touch with teams or adjudicators who go missing: will they have reliable phone numbers? Can you get a list of institutional reps who can be reliably called? You want to have processes in place for chasing up adjudicators who do things such as make scoring mistakes as soon as possible in order to minimise delays."

msgid "How will critical information be shared between the tab team, adjudication core, and logistics/convening teams? For smaller/medium sized tournaments a group chat augmented by phone calls (assuming everyone knows everyone else's number) can be sufficient, but even then, you need to ensure that any critical information conveyed privately (i.e. in a call or in person) is conveyed back to the group channel. At very large tournaments (or if you have the resources) walkie-talkies are an excellent way to manage communication — just make sure you have (ahead of time) reserve the different channels to a distinct and known purpose (i.e. general discussion; just the tab team & adjudication core; just convenors)."

There should be as few canonical sources (ideally one) of data as possible; i.e. there should be a single sheet for individual details, a single sheet for team details, etc; and these should be maintained all the way through to check-in. For both you, and the registration team, having multiple conflicting or outdated copies of data will lead to errors. However, for the registration team these errors can usually be easily sorted out in person (at check-in) but for you that information always needs to be reliable and up to date otherwise what is imported into the tab cannot be trusted."

Depending on your adjudication core's preferences and your tab software's allowances it is not unheard of for them to maintain full manual control over scores by reading/processing feedback results but only ever manually adjusting scores as a result (rather than having it automatically adjust due to the ratings in the feedback)."

At large tournaments it is not unusual for an adjudication core member to sit off each round to review and process feedback — there isn't really a good stretch of available time to do so otherwise. However even if doing this note that there are communication issues to manage here, as each adjudication core member will each end up with a relatively incomplete overview of the total volume of feedback."
msgstr ""

#: ../../guide/tournament-logistics.rst:98
msgid "If possible it's nice to plan in advance for when the tab will be released (i.e. on the last night; the day after; etc.) as this often gets left to the last minute to be decided. Also the possibility of whether people can redact themselves from tabs should be raised, as that might be useful to inform participants of during online registration or tournament briefings. In a similar fashion, some adjudication cores might also want to limit speaker tabs to only a certain number of places, particularly at novice-centric tournaments."

msgid "How to handle the submission of scoresheets and feedback, primarily in terms of which parts of the process should be done online and offline. Some adjudication cores will have strong thoughts here; others will happily follow whatever you recommend. Key considerations:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../guide/tournament-logistics.rst:104
msgid "Paper-based feedback is much more taxing to enter than paper-based scoresheets —  typically there is much more of it; it asks for a greater variety of data; and it is submitted at inconsistent times. The one advantage is that it is easier to make feedback mandatory with paper, as you can ensure all teams and adjudicators have done so prior to leaving the room. Thus, in most cases, a good online feedback system is much more preferable than paper. If using paper be aware that you will need a lot of volunteers to ensure the feedback is collected promptly. If internet or smartphone access is limited at your tournament it is probably best to accommodate both paper-based and online methods."
msgstr ""

#: ../../guide/tournament-logistics.rst:105
msgid "The consequences of having incorrect or missing ballots are much more severe than for feedback. As such major tournaments use paper ballots in some form as the final stage in a checking process to ensure that the results of a debate are definitely correct — adjudicators will always make mistakes and while digital ballots can catch/prevent some types of error (i.e. a low point win) they can't catch others (assigning the wrong scores to the wrong speaker, nominating the wrong winning team, etc.). Assuming your software supports both options, the choice is thus whether to use a hybrid approach (online submission followed by paper verification) or to rely entirely on paper. A fully-paper based approach will be simpler for both yourself and adjudicators, and can be almost as efficient if you have a sufficient number of volunteers. In contrast, a hybrid approach will be potentially much faster if you are short of volunteers and if you expect that almost all adjudicators will have access to the internet, a smartphone, and are capable of following instructions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../guide/tournament-logistics.rst:107
msgid "In some circuits, and when using some particular tab software, tournaments might run a 'dual tab' where there is a second, independent, version of the tab software and database into which all data is *also* entered. From what we understand this performs a dual role, as both a backup system that can take over from the main one (say if internet access drops) and as a way of verifying ballot data (by comparing draws or databases between software rather than having a two-step entry process operating for a single tab). This practice seems obsolete when working with modern web-based tab software that is capable of backing up and restoring to an offline system, but we would like to hear your feedback if you think that is not the case."

Because the nature of this data is sensitive and evolving, there must be a single location where it can be easily captured and verified as having been entered into the tab. Conflicts data should never be spread across a loose collection of emails/personal messages/spreadsheets; otherwise keeping track and knowing which ones have been entered into the system will be painful and error prone.

Whether you do or don't do this, ensure that adjudication core members know to come to the tab room ASAP after they have finished adjudications rather than swanning around socialising or going to lunch.

The precursor to this is yourself knowing how your tab system allocation works: what is the relationship between a debate's bracket (or assigned priority/energy) and the numeric ranking of the automatically generated panel? Does the software optimise panel strength for a voting majority, or across all panellists? When does the software allocate solo chairs over panels? How does it avoid conflicts? Does it have (and enforce) particular expectations for a given adjudicator's score; or does it rely on a more relative comparison?

If your feedback ranking system is mismatched with how you expect the automatic allocation to place adjudicators, or if the distribution of adjudicators across the draw is not what you expect, the adjudication core will end up wasting significant amounts of time adjusting allocations. Even if things work well using the default settings, ensure you experiment and demonstrate the consequences of changing the settings just to show that it can be done, what the general effects are, and to see if there are even-better configurations."

Emphasize that both do not necessarily require technical skills and that tabbers are (or should be) open to feedback and ideas from the wider community. Tell people to come find you and chat if they are interested and put up a link to the `Facebook tabbing group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681761898801915/?ref=bookmarks>`_."

This would also be a good point to remind people that their timekeeping apps shouldn't be making noise *unless* they have been explicitly assigned to keep time by the chair."
