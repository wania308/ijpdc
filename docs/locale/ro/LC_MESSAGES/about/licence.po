msgid "We haven't released Tabbycat under an open-source licence, so there is no formal and general right to use this software. Nonetheless, you're welcome to freely use Tabbycat to help run a debating tournament if it is a not-for-profit and not-for-fundraising activity. A voluntary donation of A$1 (Australian dollar) per team would be greatly appreciated, and would help us meet costs and justify our ongoing work and support for Tabbycat users. (A donation link is in the footer of your Tabbycat site.)"

msgid "If you use Tabbycat at a tournament where any individual or organisation is making a profit or raising funds (other than to cover the direct costs of the tournament), you or your tournament **must** make a donation of A$1 (Australian dollar) per team to the Tabbycat maintenance team, as outlined in each tournamentâ€™s donation page (the link is in the footer of your Tabbycat site). This includes instances where organisations run tournaments partly as fundraising activities and applies even if the organisation itself is a non-profit."
