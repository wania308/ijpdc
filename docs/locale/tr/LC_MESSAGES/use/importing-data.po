In this case, the easiest thing to do is to edit the database via the Django administrative interface (under Setup > Edit Database)."

We have a generic importer framework that should make this easier, so for some tournaments it might (very conceivably) be faster to write your own importer to conform to your data, than it is to make your data conform to our importer. You need a background in Python in order to do this. For more details, see :ref:`tournament-data-importers`."
