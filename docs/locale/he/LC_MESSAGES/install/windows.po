The easiest way to find it (on Windows 7 and later) is to search for it in your Start Menu. Every line in the instructions that begins with ``>`` is a command that you need to run in PowerShell, but without the ``>``: that sign is a convention used in instructions to make it clear that it is a command you need to run."
